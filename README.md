# SIR_Modeling

This repository contains my final project for Numerical Analysis (Math 9) at the University of California, Irvine.
In this project, I describe the Susceptible, Infected, and Recovering (SIR) model, a collection of ordinary 
differential equations meant to simulate disease spread within a population. Using MATLAB, we demonstrate using
the SIR model on a fictional scenario and using data from the 1968 Flu pandemic in New York City. This project is
based on a section of the paper "The SIR model for spread of disease" by D. Smith and L. Moore.
